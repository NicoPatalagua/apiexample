# APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE üåê
_An API is a set of definitions and protocols used to develop and integrate application software._

APIs allow your products and services to communicate with others, without needing to know how they are implemented. This simplifies application development and saves time and money. APIs give you flexibility; they simplify application design, management and use, and provide opportunities for innovation, which is ideal when designing new tools and products (or managing existing ones).

‚ö†**NOTE:** _In the field of APIs, REST (Representational State Transfer) is, today, the alpha and omega of application service development._

# API REST üåê

_When it comes to Rest API, it means using an API to access back-end applications, so that communication is carried out with the standards defined by the Rest architecture style._

One of the most important factors when using a website with Rest API is the ease of communication with other applications. The interfaces allow adding functionalities or information to the website in a simple, fast and secure way.
